# binary_clock
Code for the Binary Clock Project using 20 LEDs

This code runs on a Microchip AVR ATMega88 microcontroller. It receives a serial data stream from a DCF77 receiver module. From this data stream, the current time is calculated and the math is done to display the time in a binary format using 20 LEDs.
